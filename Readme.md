🧩 4. Mini Project – User Info Typecaster

🧠 Objective :

Create a small interactive program that collects user information using prompt() for different data types, then converts each input to its correct type using typecasting and finally displays the value along with its data type.

🧩 Instructions :

Ask the user the following information using prompt():

Name → String
Age → Number
Is Student → Boolean
Favorite Number → Number
Nickname → String

Convert each input to its correct type using:

String()
Number()
Boolean()

Display each value and its type using console.log().

📘 Expected Output:

👤 Name: Hammad - string
🎂 Age: 25 - number
🎓 Is Student: true - boolean
💫 Favorite Number: 7 - number
🏷️ Nickname: Shamir - string
